    "## FRC Team Analysis\n",
    "#### By Draven Schilling, 10/18/19\n",
    "\n",
    "The First Robotics competition is a high school level robotics competition where teams across the world are introduced to a new engineering challenge every year and are given 10 weeks to design, build, and test their robots; then in the following weeks are eligible to compete at local, district, and regional competitions. Finally, regional winners and special award winners are invited to attend the FRC championship to play aginst the best of the best and determine who the 'world champions' that year are. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this report I will be analyzing team performance over the years to identify correlations in what makes a successful team. The dataset I have acquired was created specifically for this purpose and was obtained by scraping “The Blue Alliance API”. The Blue Alliance is the largest mainstream resource for storing FIRST competition data from each year. From the API I was able to obtain regional, district, and chapionship data for each team each year. This included regional data such as where the competitions was located and the event type; Also I was able to obtain team statistics per competition (wins : losses : ties) and interpreted data such as offensive and defensive power rating. Finally I was able to get measures to classify success such as total number awards a team achieved and number of both regional and championship wins.\n",
    " \n",
    "Some initial hypothesizes I have about the data is that there may be regional “hotspots” of good teams such as the Silicon Valley area or the east coast. I also hypothesize that teams with more total awards go to more competitions and generally have higher opr’s (offensive power rating) and ccwm’s (calculated contribution to winning margin). I also predict teams that have any championship wins are consistently better than average teams or that regional winners usually have higher opr’s then dpr’s (defensive power rating)"
